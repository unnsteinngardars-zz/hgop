# Docker exercise
This assignment was about getting to know Docker and Docker Compose.
Installing, create a container, run it locally, associate the image with a
repository and a tag, and publishing it by uploading it to the corresponding repository.

## What is Docker
Docker is a service which eliminates the need for Virtual Machines
It uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel to allow
independent containers to run within a single instance.

## What is the difference between:
* Virtual Machine
* Docker container
* Docker image

Virtual machine is a Virtual environment hosting a whole operating system, uses much RAM
Docker container uses the host machine kernel so multiple containers can share the same kernel, uses less RAM
Image is a set of layers, a kind of blueprint, a running instance of an image is a container.

## What is docker-compose
A tool for defining and running multiple container docker applications

## Results
We learned how this very useful tool works and look forward to get to know it in more depth.
